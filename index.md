The [Austrian Society for Artificial Intelligence (ASAI)](https://www.asai.ac.at/) aims to bring together AI researchers from Austria. To do this, we will organize a networking event to further connect the Austrian AI community. The event is co-located with the [ASAI Summer School 2023](https://caiml.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/news/34/). The idea is to bring together researchers in the broader area of AI for networking and discussions. In the scope of the Summer School, the ASAI event furthermore gives early-stage researchers the opportunity to connect with experienced researchers and research groups all over Austria.

The meeting will be held at TU Vienna on July 5, at [TU Vienna, GM 5](https://www.tuwien.at/tu-wien/organisation/zentrale-bereiche/gebaeude-und-technik/veranstaltungsservice-und-lehrraumsupport/raumdatenbank/hoersaele/gm-5-praktikum-hoersaal) .

Towards the goals of the workshop, we aim to have two main agenda items: short presentations of the research groups, and networking and discussion opportunities.

## Research Group Presentations

Within the event, we would like to give AI research groups in Austria the opportunity to present themselves. This should be a five-minute short presentation where participating groups have the opportunitiy to

- present your unit or organization,
- present research questions your group currently works on.


## Important Dates
- Express interest for group presentation until May 15, 2023
- Registration opens: June 5, 2023 
- Submission of final group presentation (slides & poster PDFs): June 15, 2023
- Date of workshop: July 5, 2023, 15:00-18:00
