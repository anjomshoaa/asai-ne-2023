We would like to take the opportunity to bring together AI researchers from Austria. To do this, we will organize an informal satellite event to further connect the Austrian AI community. The idea is to bring together researchers in the broader area of AI under the umbrella of the Austrian Society for Artificial Intelligence, which is organizing this event. 

The meeting will be held at TU Vienna on July 5, 2023 and will be held at [TU Vienna, GM 5](https://www.tuwien.at/tu-wien/organisation/zentrale-bereiche/gebaeude-und-technik/veranstaltungsservice-und-lehrraumsupport/raumdatenbank/hoersaele/gm-5-praktikum-hoersaal) .

Towards the goals of the workshop, we aim to have two main agenda items: short presentations of the research groups, and networking and discussion opportunities.

## Research Group Presentations

Within the event, we would like to give AI research groups in Austria the opportunity to present themselves. This should be a five-minute short presentation containing the following:

- present your unit or organization,
- present research questions your group currently works on.


## Networking and Discussions

The main goal of the event is networking and enabling new collaborations and discussion amongst Austrian AI researchers, in line with the goals of ASAI and Uniko, recently published in a joint position paper [1], to strengthen the community and, apart from research, to also discuss broader topics such as Austriaâ€™s AI strategy [2] and the role of the academic Austrian research community within.
