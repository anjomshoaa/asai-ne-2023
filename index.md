The [Austrian Society for Artificial Intelligence (ASAI)](https://www.asai.ac.at/) is planning a networking event to bring together experts, researchers and enthusiasts from all over the country. This event aims to provide a platform for attendees to share their knowledge, insights and ideas on the latest developments in AI and to foster new collaborations and partnerships. With a diverse lineup of project presentations and AI community members, the event promises to be an exciting and informative experience for all participants.

 The event is co-located with the [ASAI Summer School 2023](https://caiml.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/news/34/). The idea is to bring together researchers in the broader area of AI for networking and discussions. In the scope of the Summer School, the ASAI event furthermore gives early-stage researchers the opportunity to connect with experienced researchers and research groups all over Austria.

The meeting will be held on July 5, 2023 at [TU Vienna](https://www.tuwien.at/).

Towards the goals of this event, there will be short presentations of the research groups, along with opportunities for networking and productive discussions.

## Research Group Presentations

During the event, we aim to provide a platform for AI research groups in Austria to showcase themselves and their projects via five-minute short presentations where participating groups have the opportunitiy to

- present their unit or organization, 
- present research questions their group currently works on, 
- and their state-of-the-art projects and products.


## Important Dates
- Express interest for group presentation until May 15, 2023
- Registration opens: May 20, 2023 
- Submission of final group presentation (slides & poster PDFs): June 15, 2023
- Date of workshop: July 5, 2023, 15:30-18:30

## Networking and Discussions

The main goal of the event is networking and enabling new collaborations and discussion amongst Austrian AI researchers, in line with the goals of ASAI and Uniko, recently published in a joint position paper [1], to strengthen the community and, apart from research, to also discuss broader topics such as Austria’s AI strategy [2] and the role of the academic Austrian research community within.
