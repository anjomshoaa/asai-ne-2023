The [Austrian Society for Artificial Intelligence (ASAI)](https://www.asai.ac.at/) aims to bring together AI researchers from Austria. To do this, we will organize a networking event to further connect the Austrian AI community. The event is co-located with the [ASAI Summer School 2023](https://caiml.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/news/34/). The idea is to bring together researchers in the broader area of AI for networking and discussions. In the scope of the Summer School, the ASAI event furthermore gives early-stage researchers the opportunity to connect with experienced researchers and research groups all over Austria.

The meeting will be held at TU Vienna on July 5, at [TU Vienna](https://www.tuwien.at/).

Towards the goals of the workshop, we aim to have two main agenda items: short presentations of the research groups, and networking and discussion opportunities.

## Research Group Presentations

Within the event, we would like to give AI research groups in Austria the opportunity to present themselves. This should be a five-minute short presentation where participating groups have the opportunitiy to

- present your unit or organization,
- present research questions your group currently works on.


## Important Dates
- Express interest for group presentation until May 15, 2023
- Registration opens: June 5, 2023 
- Submission of final group presentation (slides & poster PDFs): June 15, 2023
- Date of workshop: July 5, 2023, 15:00-18:00

## Networking and Discussions

The main goal of the event is networking and enabling new collaborations and discussion amongst Austrian AI researchers, in line with the goals of ASAI and Uniko, recently published in a joint position paper [1], to strengthen the community and, apart from research, to also discuss broader topics such as Austria’s AI strategy [2] and the role of the academic Austrian research community within.
