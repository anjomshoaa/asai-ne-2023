Call for Research Group Presentations
Within the event, we would like to give AI research groups in Austria the opportunity to present themselves. This should be a five-minute short presentation containing the following:
present your unit or organization,
present research questions your group currently works on.
If you are interested in presenting your research group, please submit your application via EasyChair here: [easychair.org/conferences/?conf=asaise2023](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=asaise2023). Presentations will take place in the form of five-minute lightning talks, as well as a poster session. In order to apply for a presentation slot, please provide the following information in your submission:
Submission guideline:
	Name and a short description of your research group (up to 1 page).
	List of research topics.
	List of up to 5 selected publications.
As a presenter you are invited to bring a poster with details about your research, aiming to give young researchers the possibility to present and discuss their work in an informal atmosphere during the networking session (poster format details will be communicated upon acceptance of the presentation proposals). Talk slides and posters will be published on the event website.
Networking and Discussions
The main goal of the event is networking and enabling new collaborations and discussion amongst Austrian AI researchers, in line with the goals of ASAI and Uniko, recently published in a joint position paper [1], to strengthen the community and, apart from research, to also discuss broader topics such as Austria’s AI strategy [2] and the role of the academic Austrian research community within.
